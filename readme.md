# Setup Instruction

1. Create a folder with any name _(I suggest a directory name which will be ignored by git)_ of your choices
2. Create a file with name `notebook_config.py` or anything suits for you best
3. Create a `.env` file and create a variable with value like: `DJANGO_PROJECT="your_project_name"`
4. Open notebook using `ctrl + shift  +P` for mac `Cmd + Shift + P`
5. Chose kernel as you project default environment
6. Open/create a notebook and `from notebook_config from init_django` and `init_django(project_name="your_project_name")`
7. That's it now you're free to do crazy staff ðŸ˜‰
